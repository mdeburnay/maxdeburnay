# Hi there 👋

## About Me
👨‍💻 I'm Max, a Software Engineer at [Caleb & Brown](https://www.calebandbrown.com/), working on backend applications and services that will enable the business to have a revolutionary affect on the Cryptocurrency space.

📚 Outside of work, I like to keep on top of the latest news within the world of software, reading articles from HackerNews, Lobsters, daily.dev and TLDR.

🏃‍♂️ My hobbies include socialising with friends, a lot of exercise and always setting myself a yearly physical challenge. This year will be cycling the [NC500](https://www.northcoast500.com/) 🚴‍♂️
